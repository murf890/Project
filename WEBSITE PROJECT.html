    <h2 id="Leisure"><u>Leisure</u></h2>
    <p> Being a collge student is very time consuming and stressful.  This made me realise I needed to have good time managemnt, not just have for schoolwork but also for my mental health.
    Destressing is very good for a person and doing things in their free time will help make sure they do not get get overwhelmed.
    College students especially need time to rest their minds and recharge their batteries.  It is very draining and sometimes I feel like I never not have busy week.
    So, during my limited leisure time I try to indulge in hobbies that help me forgot about school for a while.
    I am a big outside person, espcially during the fall and summer seasons.  I love to take a drive through a fall road, do fall festive activties such as pumpkin painting and going to a pumpkin patch.
    During the summer I love to swim in my pool and go to a scenic overlook to watch the sunset.  During the colder months like the Christmas season, I love decorating the Chridtmas Tree and snuggling with friends and family to watch Christmas movies.
    I love to create anyway I can through any meduim. It can be paint, hand drawn and digitially created.  Reading is also another thing that relaxes me. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/143325987@N07/">Flicker account to see my pieces of work.</a></p>

    <p>The time I have spent so far ay college have taught me valauble skills. Such as time mangamant to help me balance
    my time between my school work and personal time.  What assigments need to get done first and pritorize the more important ones.  Also teamwork is a big part of being a designer.
    Collaborating with people is so benefical, it can give me ideas that I might never would have thought of and give me feedback.
    Also that the only way you can accomplsih what you want in life is hard work and to challenge myself, that is the only way I can learn and grow on my skills.
    Communication is another thing I acquired.  Communicating correctly will help make sure my message is clear and concise.  Being able to talk with people is important because
    it shows I have good social skills.</p>
